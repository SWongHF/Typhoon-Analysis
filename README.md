# Typhoon Analysis
This project is a web crawler written in Python that fetches typhoon data from "http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/digital-typhoon/ibtracs/" and generates data related to typhoons. The goal of this project is to analyze typhoon patterns and produce an image representing the path of typhoons from 1992 to 2022, covering a span of 20 years.

# Features
- Fetches typhoon data from a database and filters it to clean the data.
- Recognizes typhoon strength and wind speed.
- Manipulates Excel files with openpyxl to enable further analysis.
- Generates an image representing the path of typhoons from 1992 to 2022.

# Usage
The code is available in the form of a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb). To use this project, you can download the file and open it in Jupyter Notebook, running Anaconda 3.9. From there, you can run the code and generate the desired output.
