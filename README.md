# Typhoon-Analysis
This project is a web crawler written in Python that fetches typhoon data from "http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/digital-typhoon/ibtracs/ â†—" and generates data related to typhoons. The goal of this project is to analyze typhoon patterns and produce an image representing the path of typhoons from 1992 to 2022, covering a span of 20 years.

# Features
- Fetches typhoon data from a database and filters it to clean the data.
- Recognizes typhoon strength and wind speed.
- Manipulates Excel files with openpyxl to enable further analysis.
- Generates an image representing the path of typhoons from 1992 to 2022.
